## Book Club

A responsive web app built with React, modelled on a simple book club. The idea for this project came from a desire to play with real-time data visualizations, in order to analyze book data (author age, nationality, gender) across all book club members as well as broken down by individual member.

### Technologies

Built with React (16.9.0), Chart.js (2.8.0), and styled with Bootstrap (4.3.1).
